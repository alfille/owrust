//! **owrust** Rust library interfaces with owserver to use 1-wire devices 
//!
//! This is a tool in the 1-wire file system **OWFS**
//!
//! This library is the central part of **owrust** -- the _rust language_ OWFS programs
//! * **OWFS** [documentation](https://owfs.org) and [code](https://github.com/owfs/owfs)
//! * **owrust** [repository](https://github.com/alfille/owrust)
//!
//! ## PURPOSE
//! lib.rs is the library code that actually performs the **owserver protocol**.
//! Communication with **owserver** is over TCP/IP (network) using an efficient well-documented protocol.
//!
//! Supported operations are read, write, dir, present and size, with some variations
//!
//! The main struct is OwClient which holds all the configuration information.
//! Typically it is populated by the command line or configuration files
//!
//! ## EXAMPLES
//! ```
//! use owrust ; // basic library
//! use owrust::parse_args ; // configure from command line, file or OsString
//!
//! let mut owserver = owrust::new() ; // create an OwClient struct
//!   // configure from command line and get 1-wire paths
//! let paths = parse_args::command_line( &mut owserver ) ;
//!   // Call any of the OwClient functions like dir, read, write,...
//!   ```

//
// This is a Rust version of my C owfs code for talking to 1-wire devices via owserver
// Basically owserver can talk to the physical devices, and provides network access via my "owserver protocol"
